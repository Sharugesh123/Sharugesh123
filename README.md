## 🛠 Core Technical Focus

| Area | What I Do |
|------|-----------|
| **Backend Architecture** | API design, layered services, DTO mapping, exception handling |
| **Java + Spring Boot** | Controllers, Services, JPA/Hibernate, validation, security basics |
| **SQL & Data Structuring** | Schema modeling, joins, indexing, optimization, ACID logic |
| **API Communication** | JSON standards, pagination, filtering, request tracing |
| **Testing & Debugging** | Postman workflows, error logs, status code accuracy |

## 📌 Work Philosophy
> Structured code, predictable behavior, detailed validation, and clean logging.

- Write clarity before cleverness  
- Database must match business logic, not “just store data”  
- API must fail gracefully, not loudly  
- Errors ≠ exceptions: they must explain cause, not crash systems

## 🧩 Featured Backend Projects

### 1. Transaction Monitoring & Fraud Detection System  
`Java • Spring Boot • MySQL • Risk Engine`  
Designed fraud rules, dashboards for flagged cases, and consistent audit tracking.

**Highlights**
- Rule scoring for unusual spend patterns
- Clear API flow: transaction → evaluation → risk tag → response
- Detailed error surfaces + JSON response uniformity

---

### 2. E-Commerce Product Management System  
`Java • Spring Boot • MySQL • REST`  
Inventory CRUD with precise admin handling.

**What Matters**
- Product existence validation before update/delete  
- Consistent naming & pagination for reliable API responses  
- Predictable DB schema → predictable inventory state

## 🎯 Strength in Backend Thinking

| Principle | Execution |
|----------|-----------|
| **Idempotent APIs** | repeat calls ≠ duplicate writes |
| **Consistent JSON Spec** | same error structure everywhere |
| **Schema Discipline** | no hidden nulls, no loose types |
| **Validation First** | API gates bad data early |
| **Traceability** | logs → predictable → debuggable |

## 🧭 Learning Direction (Current)
- Solidify microservices messaging (Kafka basics)
- Understand caching workflows (Redis fundamentals)
- Hands-on improvement in DB indexing and profiling
